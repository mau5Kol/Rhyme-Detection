I'm from the bronx, blastmaster krs-one
Provin that my job ain't done until i get some
More, no need to roar or yell
Cos i can still tell what will sell
And would have sold without yellin over a drum roll
That style is old, so unfold
Blossom, bloom, you got the room
So go ahead and consume
A new era, krs-one comes better
Bite another lyric? never
Cos i'm too clever
however
I own my own label
Partners with scott larock, he's on the turntable
And partner lee smith
I'm exercising a true gift just to uplift
Hip-hop, hip-hop My voice is like a monster
And now a word from our sponsor

Two, three, four, five, sex, seven, eight, nine, ten
I gotta start this rhyme again
How many words can i find that rhyme
And still keep in mind every lyric must come out on time
Not many but i have plenty
Scott larock sent me just to devastate any-
One, any daughter, any son that comes my way
Hey, you got to go the other way
I represent my dj scott larock D-nice, the beat box
I only wear nike's, not adidas or reeboks
Many people know me, yet i'm known by few My name is krs-one
son
Not two or three or four or five or six
The mix is on scott larock and scott larock is on the mix

Cool like the air we breathe Inhale, exhale, perpetrators will fail
As sure as my name is "blastmaster krs" Sit and listen to the very essence of this tale
From the days of prison i have uprisen
To my family members i'm marked down as missin
Listen, circumstances put me right in the street
With the will to survive, get paid, eat, and sleep
Some weep, or should i rather say some cry
Can't get by so later on they die
Because the strong will survive The weak will perish
Ignorance is a poison and knowledge will nourish
I love what i got and like what i had
I'm glad, not sad, and i don't even get mad
I get even, myself and some others i believe in
Cos these others are my brothas and perfection we're achievin
Yes, my name is krs, my brother is a rasta
Let me pause, and now a word from our sponsor
